	<p> Entry 1, October 5, 2022: I have been trying to get my website to link to my code for a long time now. I have had some struggles and confusion which have been resolved and I am well on my way to having a good websote.</p>

	<p> Entry 2, October 12, 2022: My website is up and running and I like the look of it. My pages are linking and I am about to start my first project!</p>
	<p>Entry 3: October 19, 2022: I linked my person card to the cs1 team website which is a huge step forward. I am working on the general aesthetic of my website before I can start my my first project.</p>

	<p> Entry 4: October 26, 2022: I have not had class since last Wednesday so I will admit, I have not done much work since my last entry. Today I will try to finally move on, considering my work has not really advanced. </p>
