	<p> Entry 1, October 5, 2022: I have been trying to get my website to link to my code for a long time now. I have had some struggles and confusion which have been resolved and I am well on my way to having a good websote.</p>

	<p> Entry 2, October 12, 2022: My website is up and running and I like the look of it. My pages are linking and I am about to start my first project!</p>
	<p>Entry 3: October 19, 2022: I linked my person card to the cs1 team website which is a huge step forward. I am working on the general aesthetic of my website before I can start my my first project.</p>

	<p> Entry 4: October 26, 2022: I have not had class since last Wednesday so I will admit, I have not done much work since my last entry. Today I will try to finally move on, considering my work has not really advanced. </p>

	Entry 5: December 9, 2022: I have not updated the jounral in about a month and a half. Since then I have been up to some pretty good work. I published my first project, and I have a couple more in the works that should be published in the next week or so. I still am a little behind on the work but I have been meeting with my teacher to make sure I catch up.

		Entry 6: Febuary 10, 2023: I just finished my valentines day project for Squilliam. It was pretty easy because it did not require any javascript. I was able to do most of the code in the style section and still make the project turn out great. I am super happy with how to turned out and I think it's one of my best projects.

		Entry 7: Febuary 24, 2023: I am working on my car project at the moment and I am making some good progress. I am up to date on all projects, which I am proud of because my first semester was nothing like this at all. e

		Entry 8: May 31, 2023: I finished all my projects and am about to push everything. I had a good run this year and made a lot of improvement. I finished with lots of projects that I think are pretty good. I really enjoyed my time in comp sci this year.
